    <p>
        An HTML tag is a special word or letter surrounded by angle brackets, &lt; and &gt;. You use tags to create HTML elements, such as paragraphs or links.

Many elements have an opening tag and a closing tag — for example, a p (paragraph) element has a &lt;p&gt; tag, followed by the paragraph text, followed by a closing &lt;/p&gt; tag.

Some elements don’t have a closing tag. These are called empty elements. For example, the br element for inserting line breaks is simply written &lt;br&gt;.
